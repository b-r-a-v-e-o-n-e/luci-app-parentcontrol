Parental control, you can control machines by time, port and keyword filtering, etc.
This parental control was developed in 2022 by a certain student in the group who asked me to pay for customized interface development. The original code was open source online but it did not meet the requirements. I asked me to develop it a second time. Now I have made the code open source through an agreement with the demander! Thank you all for your support and encouragement! ! It can also be regarded as a contribution to the OPENWRT open source code!
Of course, this code itself is not a very advanced code. It should be used as a starting point. If there are any shortcomings, you are welcome to work with ISSE to make it better.
The initial version refers to Lienol's large URL filtering source code and some online open source codes
